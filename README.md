# SwiftAsyncOperation

OperaionQueue async operation for Swift >= 3 based on block.

It helps to run async operations with ability to be canceled.

## History

### 1.1.0
 - Removed checking of *isCanceled* in *start* routine, because in another case *job* callback is not called and user logic cannot determine if operation was canceled without overriding *cancel* method.
 
### 1.0.0

 - Initial version


## Installation

### Cocoapods

```ruby
pod 'SwiftAsyncOperation'
```

## Usage

### Importing

```swift
import SwiftAsyncOperation
```

### Adding operation

```swift
let operation = AsyncOperation(job: { operation, completion in
            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2, execute: {
                self.label!.text = "Done"
                completion()
            })
        })
        
operationQueue.addOperation(operation)
```

or directly with block:

```swift
operationQueue.addAsyncOperation { (operation, completion) in
            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2, execute: {
                self.label!.text = "Done 3"
                completion()
            })
        }
```

### Cancelation

```swift
let canceledOperation = AsyncOperation(job: { operation, completion in
            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2, execute: {
                if !operation.isCancelled {
                    self.label!.text = "Done 2"
                }
                completion()
            })
        })
        
operationQueue.addOperation(canceledOperation)
canceledOperation.cancel()
```
